# Creating Your First Invoice

Generating a professional document is the core of the ESSAR platform. Follow these steps to ensure accuracy and compliance:

### 1. Initiate the Process
From any screen, you can click the **"New Invoice"** button in the top navigation or the **"Issue New Invoice"** button on the Invoices listing page.

### 2. Select Your Client
Use the Client search field to select an existing corporate entity. If the client is new, you must first register them in the **Clients** module.

### 3. Add Line Items
- Select products from your inventory catalog.
- Adjust quantities (**Qty**).
- Tax rates (GST) are automatically calculated based on your company settings and the product's HSN code.

### 4. Review and Finalize
Verify the **Subtotal**, **Tax Total**, and **Grand Total**. Once verified, click **"Finalize Invoice"**. 

> [!TIP]
> Use the **"Preview PDF"** feature to see exactly how the document will look before sending it to your client.

# Platform Status Guide

The ESSAR platform uses color-coded status indicators to help you track your receivables at a glance:

- **DRAFT**: The invoice is being prepared and has not been finalized. It does not yet impact your financial dashboard.
- **SENT**: The invoice has been issues and sent to the client. It is now part of your **Outstanding Receivables**.
- **PAID**: Payment has been confirmed in full.
- **PARTIAL**: A payment has been recorded, but a balance remains.
- **OVERDUE**: The due date has passed without full payment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The platform automatically transitions invoices to **OVERDUE** every midnight if they are still in 'SENT' or 'PARTIAL' state past their due date.

# Account Security

ESSAR utilizes enterprise-grade security protocols to protect your sensitive financial data.

### Secure Sessions
The platform uses **HttpOnly Secure Cookies** for all authentication. This means your login session is protected from most browser-level vulnerabilities.

### Access Control
- **ADMIN**: Full access to all modules, settings, and user management.
- **EDITOR**: Can create and manage billing/inventory but cannot modify system settings.
- **VIEWER**: Read-only access to reports and tracking.

### Best Practices
1. **Never share your password**.
2. **Log out** when using a shared terminal.
3. Ensure your **JWT_SECRET** is updated periodically in your server configuration.
